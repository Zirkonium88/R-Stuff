# Welcome to my R repository

This repository will provide some examples from my daily R workloads and parts of my PhD studies. Like everyone in the field of educational psychology, I dealed with challenging statistical problems. I will report about them.

## Specifying a multi-group longitudinal CFA

This example shows you how to use [`lavaan`](http://lavaan.ugent.be/tutorial/cfa.html), [`knitr`](https://yihui.name/knitr/), [`semTools`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/semTools/index.html), [`kableExtra`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html) and [`psych`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/psych/index.html) to generate a multi-group longitudinal CFA. Additionally, the examples shows you how to automize the necessary table production for the results of the [measurement invariances testing](). It was used as a part of thesis, written with [`bookdown`](https://bookdown.org).
